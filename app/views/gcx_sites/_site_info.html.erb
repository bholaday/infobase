<h2>How To Manage Your Website</h2>

<p>
  Before you get started there are a couple terms you'll need to be familiar with.
</p>

<p>
<strong>GCX:</strong> Built by Cru's Global Technology office, GCX is the host website creator, allowing you to easily build your own version of our Cru branded websites.
</p>
<p>
<strong>WordPress:</strong> WordPress is a free 3rd party blogging tool that allows you to customize your own web page. We host our themes (backgrounds and layouts) through this site. It is the industry standard for user-friendly, personal web site creation. GCX was built on top of WordPress.
</p>

Here is the link to manage your site: <%= link_to("http://www.cru.org/s/#{activity.gcx_site}/wp-admin", "http://www.cru.org/s/#{activity.gcx_site}/wp-admin", target: '_blank') %>
<br /><br />
Please bookmark that link for future reference. <br /><br />
Once you get to your admin area, you'll find additional instructions under 'Cru Help', which you'll find at the top of the right-hand sidebar.
